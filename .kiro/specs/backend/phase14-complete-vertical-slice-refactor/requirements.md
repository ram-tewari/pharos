# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 14 completes the vertical slice architecture transformation started in Phase 13.5. While Phase 13.5 successfully extracted Collections, Resources, and Search into self-contained modules, approximately 80% of the codebase remains in the traditional layered architecture. This phase migrates all remaining domains into vertical slice modules, establishing a fully modular monolith architecture.

The remaining domains to migrate include: Annotations, Quality, Taxonomy/Classification, Recommendations, Graph/Citations/Discovery, Curation, Scholarly/Metadata, Monitoring, and shared infrastructure services (Embeddings, AI Core).

## Glossary

- **System**: Pharos backend application
- **Vertical Slice Module**: A self-contained module containing router, service, schema, model, and handlers for a specific business domain
- **Shared Kernel**: Common components used across all modules (database, event_bus, base_model, embeddings)
- **Domain Module**: A vertical slice representing a bounded context
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Modules communicate by emitting and subscribing to events rather than direct imports
- **Module Interface**: The public API exposed through a module's `__init__.py` file
- **Cross-Cutting Concern**: Functionality used by multiple modules (embeddings, AI core, caching)
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Incremental migration where new architecture gradually replaces old
