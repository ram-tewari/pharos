# Requirements Document: Phase 17.5 - Advanced RAG Architecture Upgrade

## Introduction

Phase 17.5 upgrades Pharos from "Naive RAG" to advanced RAG patterns based on the NirDiamant RAG Techniques resource. This phase decouples retrieval units from generation units, introduces semantic graph capabilities for GraphRAG, enables HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) query expansion, and implements rigorous evaluation metrics. The goal is to significantly improve retrieval quality, context relevance, and system measurability.

## Glossary
