## Celebration Time! 🎊

This is a significant milestone. We've gone from 15% test coverage to 95% coverage, implementing 44 new property tests and fixing all test failures. The Cortex Knowledge Graph feature now has robust, comprehensive test coverage that will catch regressions and ensure quality as we continue development.

**Great work! Ready to proceed to Priority 3 when you are.**
