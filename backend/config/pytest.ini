# Test configuration for Neo Alexandria

# Markers for different test types
markers =
    unit: Unit tests that should be fast and isolated
    integration: Integration tests that test multiple components
    property: Property-based tests using hypothesis
    feature: Feature-specific tests (use with feature name)
    ai: Tests that require AI functionality
    slow: Tests that take a long time to run
    requires_ai_deps: Tests that require AI dependencies (transformers, etc.)
    recommendation: Tests for the recommendation system (Phase 5.5)
    recommendation_unit: Unit tests for recommendation components
    recommendation_integration: Integration tests for recommendation system
    recommendation_api: API endpoint tests for recommendations
    recommendation_performance: Performance tests for recommendations
    recommendation_edge_cases: Edge case and error handling tests
    performance: marks tests as performance tests (deselect with '-m "not performance"')
    asyncio: marks tests as async tests
    use_real_models: marks tests that should use real ML models instead of mocks (Phase 12.6)
    postgresql: marks tests that require PostgreSQL database (Phase 13)
