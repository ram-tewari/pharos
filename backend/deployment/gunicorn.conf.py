"""
Neo Alexandria 2.0 - Production Gunicorn Configuration

This configuration file provides optimized settings for running Neo Alexandria 2.0
in production with Gunicorn and Uvicorn workers. It follows the performance best
practices outlined in the FastAPI performance article.

Usage:
    gunicorn backend.app.main:app -c gunicorn.conf.py

Features:
- Optimized worker count based on CPU cores
- Proper async worker configuration
- Memory and timeout optimizations
- Logging configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
