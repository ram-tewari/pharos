## Overview

### What Are Events?

Events are the primary mechanism for communication between modules in Pharos. Instead of modules directly calling each other (which creates tight coupling), modules emit events when something significant happens, and other modules subscribe to events they care about.

### Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture

1. **Loose Coupling**: Modules don't need to know about each other
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new subscribers without modifying emitters
3. **Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
4. **Flexibility**: Event handlers can be added/removed dynamically
5. **Auditability**: All inter-module communication is logged

### Event Bus

The event bus is implemented in `app/shared/event_bus.py` and provides:
- **Synchronous delivery**: Events are delivered immediately in the same process
- **Error isolation**: Handler failures don't affect other handlers
- **Metrics tracking**: Events emitted, delivered, and errors are tracked
- **Type safety**: Events have defined types and payloads

---

## Event Naming Conventions

### Pattern

All events follow the pattern: `{domain}.{action}`

- **domain**: The module or entity that owns the event (lowercase, singular)
- **action**: The action that occurred (past tense, snake_case)

### Examples

```
resource.created          # Resource module created a resource
resource.updated          # Resource module updated a resource
resource.deleted          # Resource module deleted a resource
collection.updated        # Collection module updated a collection
quality.computed          # Quality module computed quality scores
quality.outlier_detected  # Quality module detected an outlier
annotation.created        # Annotation module created an annotation
```

### Guidelines

1. **Use past tense**: Events describe what happened, not what will happen
2. **Be specific**: `resource.created` not `resource.changed`
3. **Use snake_case**: `outlier_detected` not `outlierDetected`
4. **Keep it short**: Prefer concise names that are still clear
5. **Avoid abbreviations**: `metadata.extracted` not `meta.ext`

## Best Practices

### For Event Emitters

1. **Emit after commit**: Always emit events AFTER database commits succeed
   ```python
   # Good
   db.commit()
   event_bus.emit("resource.created", payload)
   
   # Bad - event emitted before commit
   event_bus.emit("resource.created", payload)
   db.commit()  # Could fail!
   ```

2. **Include sufficient context**: Provide enough information for subscribers
   ```python
   # Good - includes all relevant data
   event_bus.emit("resource.created", {
       "resource_id": str(resource.id),
       "title": resource.title,
       "content_type": resource.content_type,
       "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
   })
   
   # Bad - insufficient context
   event_bus.emit("resource.created", {
       "resource_id": str(resource.id)
   })
   ```

3. **Use ISO 8601 timestamps**: Always include timestamps in ISO 8601 format
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timezone
   
   "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
   ```

4. **Don't emit on failures**: Only emit events for successful operations
   ```python
   try:
       resource = create_resource(data)
       db.commit()
       event_bus.emit("resource.created", payload)
   except Exception as e:
       db.rollback()
       # Don't emit event on failure
       raise
   ```

### For Event Subscribers

1. **Create fresh database sessions**: Always create new sessions in handlers
   ```python
   def handle_resource_created(payload: dict):
       from app.shared.database import SessionLocal
       
       db = SessionLocal()  # Fresh session
       try:
           # Process event
           pass
       finally:
           db.close()  # Always close
   ```

2. **Catch all exceptions**: Don't let handler failures affect other handlers
   ```python
   def handle_event(payload: dict):
       try:
           # Process event
           pass
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Handler error: {e}", exc_info=True)
           # Don't re-raise - let other handlers continue
       finally:
           db.close()
   ```

3. **Keep handlers fast**: Aim for <100ms execution time
   ```python
   # Good - quick processing
   def handle_event(payload: dict):
       resource_id = payload["resource_id"]
       update_cache(resource_id)  # Fast operation
   
   # Bad - slow processing
   def handle_event(payload: dict):
       resource_id = payload["resource_id"]
       recompute_all_embeddings()  # Slow! Use Celery instead
   ```

4. **Make handlers idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
   ```python
   def handle_resource_created(payload: dict):
       resource_id = payload["resource_id"]
       
       # Check if already processed
       if already_processed(resource_id):
           return
       
       # Process event
       process_resource(resource_id)
       mark_as_processed(resource_id)
   ```

5. **Log all processing**: Include event type and payload in logs
   ```python
   def handle_event(payload: dict):
       logger.info(f"Processing event: {payload}")
       try:
           # Process
           logger.info(f"Successfully processed: {payload}")
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Failed to process: {payload}", exc_info=True)
   ```

### Event Payload Guidelines

1. **Use UUIDs as strings**: Always convert UUIDs to strings
   ```python
   "resource_id": str(resource.id)  # Good
   "resource_id": resource.id       # Bad - not JSON serializable
   ```

2. **Keep payloads small**: Don't include large content
   ```python
   # Good - reference only
   "resource_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
   
   # Bad - includes full content
   "content": "..." # 10MB of text
   ```

3. **Use consistent field names**: Follow naming conventions
   ```python
   # Good - snake_case
   "resource_id", "user_id", "created_at"
   
   # Bad - mixed case
   "resourceId", "userId", "createdAt"
   ```

4. **Include metadata**: Add context for debugging
   ```python
   {
       "resource_id": "...",
       "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
       "source": "api",  # Where did this come from?
       "user_id": "..."  # Who triggered it?
   }
   ```

## Monitoring Events

### Event Bus Metrics

Check event bus health and metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/monitoring/events
```

Response:
```json
{
  "events_emitted": 1523,
  "events_delivered": 4569,
  "handler_errors": 3,
  "event_types": {
    "resource.created": 234,
    "resource.updated": 1289,
    "quality.computed": 234,
    "resource.classified": 234
  },
  "latency_ms": {
    "p50": 0.8,
    "p95": 2.3,
    "p99": 5.1
  }
}
```

### Event History

View recent events:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/monitoring/events/history?limit=10
```

Response:
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "resource.created",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "payload": {"resource_id": "..."},
      "handlers_called": 5,
      "latency_ms": 1.2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Debugging Event Issues

1. **Check if event is being emitted**:
   ```python
   # Add logging in emitter
   logger.info(f"Emitting event: {event_type}")
   event_bus.emit(event_type, payload)
   ```

2. **Check if handlers are registered**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/monitoring/events
   # Look at handler_count per event type
   ```

3. **Check handler errors**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/monitoring/events/history
   # Look for events with errors
   ```

4. **Enable debug logging**:
   ```python
   # In app/shared/event_bus.py
   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```
