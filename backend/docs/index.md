# Pharos Backend Documentation

**Your second brain for code** - AI-powered knowledge management API for developers and researchers.

## What is Pharos?

Pharos is a production-ready knowledge management system designed specifically for developers. It understands code repositories at a structural level through AST-based analysis, integrates research papers and technical documentation, and provides semantic search across your entire technical knowledge base.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Code Intelligence**: Parse and analyze Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Java repositories
- **Semantic Search**: Find code and documentation by meaning, not just keywords
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Connect code, papers, and concepts through citation networks and dependencies
- **Active Reading**: Annotate code and papers with searchable highlights and notes
- **Research Integration**: Manage academic papers alongside code with automatic metadata extraction
