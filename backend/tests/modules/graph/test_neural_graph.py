"""
Unit tests for Neural Graph Service.

These tests verify specific examples and edge cases.

NOTE: Tests that involve Node2Vec training or Qdrant uploads require:
- torch-cluster or pyg-lib (for Node2Vec)
- qdrant-client (for upload tests)

These dependencies are only available in the Edge environment (Linux with proper setup).
On Windows, only the initialization test will pass.
