# Pharos — Project Overview

> This is file 1 of 6 providing complete context on the Pharos project for Gemini / NotebookLM. It covers *what* Pharos is, *who* it is for, and *why* it exists. Files 2–6 cover architecture, data model, ingestion/search, API/deployment, and evolution/history respectively.

---

## One-Sentence Definition

**Pharos is a single-tenant, production code-intelligence backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector) that serves structured retrieval context to a local LLM coding assistant called Ronin.**

It is sometimes referred to internally by its original codename **Neo Alexandria 2.0**. The two names refer to the same system.

---

## Who It Is For

- **Developer**: Ram Tewari (solo developer, backend-focused).
- **Primary consumer of the API**: **Ronin** — a local (desktop) LLM coding assistant that Ram is also building.
- **End-user count**: 1 (single-tenant by design). Pharos is *not* a SaaS product.

Because the consumer is a deterministic program (Ronin) rather than a human, API contracts prioritize:
- Clean JSON responses with stable keys
- Sub-second latency on retrieval endpoints
- Rich, structured metadata over prose

---

## What Pharos Does (The Two Core Use Cases)

### Use Case 1: Context Retrieval (Understanding Old Code)
Ronin receives a user query like *"How does the authentication system work in myapp-backend?"* and forwards it to Pharos at `POST /api/context/retrieve` (or `POST /api/search/advanced`). Pharos returns:
1. Semantically-ranked code chunks (retrieved via pgvector HNSW cosine similarity over `nomic-embed-text-v1` 768-dim embeddings).
2. Related entities from the knowledge graph (GraphRAG multi-hop traversal).
3. Similar implementations pattern-matched from other indexed codebases.
4. Dependency sub-graphs (IMPORTS / DEFINES / CALLS relationships).

Target latency: ~800 ms total.

### Use Case 2: Pattern Learning (Generating New Code)
When Ronin needs to generate code in the user's style, it queries Pharos for:
- Historical coding patterns extracted deterministically from the user's indexed repos.
- Prior mistakes / antipatterns.
- Canonical examples with matching AST structure, imports, and function signatures.

---

## What Pharos Is NOT

- Not a hosted SaaS. Single-tenant by design.
- Not a generic RAG / note-taking tool. The code-intelligence path is first-class; everything else (annotations, scholarly papers) is secondary.
- Not a frontend-centric project. The React frontend in `frontend/` exists but is **not a priority**. All effort goes to the backend.
- Not a place that stores raw source code. Code stays on GitHub (hybrid storage); Pharos stores metadata + AST-derived semantic summaries + embeddings.

## Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Zero circular dependencies between modules.** Modules communicate only via the event bus in `app/shared/event_bus.py`.
2. **Vertical slice architecture.** Each module under `app/modules/` owns its router, service, schema (Pydantic), handlers (event listeners), model re-exports, and tests.
3. **Single source of truth for DB models.** All SQLAlchemy models live in `app/database/models.py`. Module `model.py` files only *re-export* from there. This is enforced to prevent import cycles.
4. **Cost minimalism.** Full production cost target = **$7/mo** (Render Starter only; Neon + Upstash + Tailscale + local GPU are all $0).
5. **Cloud/Edge split.** Render never loads ML models. All GPU work (embeddings, SPLADE, LLM extraction) happens on the local RTX 4070 and is reached via Tailscale Funnel or the Upstash task queue.
6. **Hybrid storage for code.** Source files stay on GitHub; Pharos stores only metadata + chunk-level semantic summaries + embeddings. `document_chunks.content` is **nullable** for code chunks — the content lives at the `github_uri` in chunk_metadata.

## Production URLs and Key Constants

- **Cloud API (actual URL)**: `https://pharos-cloud-api.onrender.com`
  - Note: `render.yaml` declares `name: pharos-api` but the *deployed* service is `pharos-cloud-api`. The YAML name is stale.
- **Health check**: `GET /health`
- **OpenAPI / Swagger**: `GET /docs`
- **M2M auth header (Ronin → Pharos)**: `Authorization: Bearer <PHAROS_ADMIN_TOKEN>`
- **Embedding model**: `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1` → 768-dim vectors
- **Edge embed server port**: `8001` (WSL2), exposed publicly via Tailscale Funnel at a URL like `https://pc.tailf7b210.ts.net`
- **Redis queues**: `pharos:tasks` (embedding tasks, polled by edge worker), `ingest_queue` (repo ingestion — currently has no worker consuming it).

## Glossary

- **Ronin** — The local LLM desktop assistant that consumes the Pharos API. Separate project from Pharos (not yet started), but planned by the same person.
- **Neo Alexandria** — Original codename for Pharos. Still appears in docstrings.
- **Edge worker** — Process running on Ram's local RTX 4070 that handles all GPU-bound work (embeddings, sparse embeddings, LLM extraction). Polls `pharos:tasks` from Upstash.
- **Cloud API** — The FastAPI process on Render. Serves HTTP; never loads ML models (`MODE=CLOUD` skips torch imports).
- **Hybrid storage** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Code files stay on GitHub, Pharos stores only `github_uri` + `branch_reference` + metadata. 17x storage reduction achieved.
- **Semantic summary** — A short, human-readable string like `"[python] def authenticate_user(username, password) -> User: 'Authenticate a user.' deps: [verify_password, db.query]"`. This is what gets embedded for code chunks — **not** the raw source.
- **DocumentChunk** — A retrievable unit. For PDFs it's a page-ish slice with `content` populated. For code it's a function/class/method with `content=NULL` and a `github_uri` pointing at the source.
- **Three-way hybrid search** — Search strategy combining keyword (FTS5/tsvector) + dense vector (pgvector) + sparse (SPLADE) results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
- **Pattern Learning** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED: `/api/patterns/learn` endpoint that analyzes repos to extract coding patterns (architecture, style, Git history).
- **Self-Improving Loop** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED: System that tracks code changes, extracts rules via LLM, and stores them as `ProposedRule` records for human review. Accepted rules become ACTIVE and influence future code generation.
- **ProposedRule** — A coding rule extracted by the local LLM from a Git diff. Status workflow: PENDING_REVIEW → ACTIVE/REJECTED.
- **CodingProfile** — Master programmer personality (e.g., "Linus Torvalds", "DHH"). Contains curated coding rules and style preferences.
- **Staleness Tracking** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-04-27): System that marks resources as stale when a repo is re-ingested with a new commit SHA. Three new columns: `is_stale` (boolean, indexed), `last_indexed_sha` (string), `last_indexed_at` (timestamp). Search queries automatically filter out stale resources.
- **Path Exclusions** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-04-27): Centralized list in `backend/app/utils/path_exclusions.py` that excludes migrations/, alembic/, __generated__, lockfiles, .min.*, _pb2.py, etc. from ingestion. Wired into all three ingest paths.
- **AST Density Gate** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-04-27): Heuristic sieve that drops files with <3 control-flow nodes (if/for/while/try) or <0.01 AST density. Prevents flat dataclasses and config files from polluting the feedback queue. Configurable via `FEEDBACK_MIN_CONTROL_FLOW_NODES` and `FEEDBACK_MIN_AST_DENSITY` settings.
- **Polyglot AST** — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-05-02): Tree-sitter-based parser factory supporting 7 languages (Python via stdlib ast, C/C++/Go/Rust/JS/TS/TSX via tree-sitter 0.23+). Extracts functions, classes, imports, and calls with consistent `SymbolInfo` format across all languages. Graceful fallback to line-chunking for unsupported languages. Implementation in `backend/app/modules/ingestion/language_parser.py` with Tree-sitter queries for each language. Semantic summaries follow format: `[lang] signature: 'docstring.' deps: [imports]`.

## Known Issues & Technical Debt (2026-04-27)

**See `ACTUAL_STATUS_2026_04_27.md` and `ACTUAL_PIPELINE_STATUS.md` for complete analysis.**

### 1. ~~Stale Data Detection Missing~~ ✅ FIXED (2026-04-27)
- **Solution**: Added `is_stale`, `last_indexed_sha`, `last_indexed_at` columns to Resource table
- **Implementation**: `mark_repo_stale_by_sha()` marks old resources stale, `mark_resources_fresh()` marks new ones fresh
- **Search Integration**: All search queries now filter `(r.is_stale IS NULL OR r.is_stale = FALSE)`
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### 2. Auth Over-Engineering (MAJOR BLOAT)
- **Problem**: Enterprise SaaS auth (OAuth2, JWT refresh, rate limiting) for single-tenant tool
- **Bloat**: ~2000 lines of unnecessary auth code
- **Needed**: Simple API key authentication
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Collections Module IS the Recommendation System
- **Clarification**: Claims of "recommendations removed" are misleading
- **Reality**: Collections module provides content-based recommendations via semantic similarity
- **Note**: This is appropriate for single-tenant (not collaborative filtering)

### 4. Classification Training Scripts Not Fully Removed
- **Problem**: Taxonomy module removed, but training scripts remain in `backend/scripts/training/`
- **Priority**: LOW (dead code cleanup)
